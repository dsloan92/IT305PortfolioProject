            When I'm not in class you can find me at Genoa Healthcare where I work full time as a Business Analyst for
            the Pharmacy Software team. I moved to Washington 4 years ago from Salt Lake City, Utah. My current job relocated me to
            Washington to become a pharmacy trainer. I have since moved up into my current position. I one day, hope to become a software
            developer for my current company for my team. I am hoping the degree I am currently persuing helps me reach that goal. Outside
            of work and school I enjoy basketball and tennis, as well as catching the newest movie at the theatres. You can catch me back
            home in Utah enjoying some of the best snow on earth. </P>

                    created a form for Volunteers to sign up for a non-profit organization, as well as a form for potential new

                     a group of websites that showcased what I had learned during the quarter. There were five different pages, each
                     page showcasing a different aspect of what we were taught, including how to create tables in HTML, as well as how to
                     format pages using CSS. Of the many pages that were created for this final project, my favorite being the Advertise a Product
                     page. I enjoyed working on making the page look cohesive by properly formatting the pages including the images. It is also a
                     great reminder on how far I have come from one of my first webpages I had ever created.</p></li>
